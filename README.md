# ReverseTheSentence

> This is just a little exercise that I created, based on 
some ways one could use a console application to 
output the reverse order or mirror a string.

It is inspired by a common interview question, one I have had
before with colleagues and previous potential employers.

# Breakdown

> The first part, we're providing a string that will be used
in an array and a then called from this section. See the image
below for reference.

> The first method takes the string array and outputs the 
string as if it was read in a mirror, the characters reversed.
Below you can see how it was written and the output below it.

> The last method simply takes the sentence in the string and 
reverses the orders of the words.  The snippet and output is below.

# Final Thoughts

> One thing that got me thinking is how to ascertain either of the
above examples could be translated from the words of a client/customer.
The reason behind this, as I come from the QA field and have had 
responsibilities involving getting such information.  

Obviously, not much would be discussed from a technical perspective to
a client/customer. Typically one might discuss the overall feature and 
what they want it to look like. They might say that they want something flipped,
reversed, verticle, etc. and this was exploratory to find out how some of that is done
programmatically.  

I learned much from this and welcome feedback and any other ideas that might help to expand on this.
Thanks for stopping by!
